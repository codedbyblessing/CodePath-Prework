## App Brainstorming 

My favorite apps:
- Notion
    - I can easily organize my code project documentation and link my calendar to the workspace.
    - The color theme is very neutral.
- Pinterest
    - I enjoy the online scrapbook vibe that it gives.
    - The recently added collage feature creates more room for artistic expression. 
- Spotify
    - I enjoy the feature they added not too long ago of creating your playlist cover.
    - The friends section adds a social aspect to it.
    - The recommendation algorithm has increased my music library and exposed me to a lot of genres.

Given these apps, I would create an app that is centered around Black culture and its creativity. I would take note of Pinterestâ€™s algorithm and combine that with unique storytelling. I would then also utilize an AI model and train it to allow the user to create their own space on the app. The app would not be socially overwhelming; I enjoy apps that are minimally social, like the ones listed above. The app would be a personalized hub dedicated to the expression of Black culture and creativity and part digital art gallery, part storytelling canvas. With AI integrated, users could curate, generate, and design their own cultural space, blending inspiration with creation. The goal would be to build a platform that uplifts voices, preserves stories, and celebrates the depth of Black artistry in a way that feels authentic, calm, and deeply personal.

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
- I had to familiarize myself with the Swift layout and see my code side by side. I have not done something like this in a while outside of Figma.
- I accidentally deleted a file and had to restart the app creation, by then I had been familiarized with Swift and XCode so it did not take too long.
